Socialization	O
One	Rebuttal-B
of	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
most	Rebuttal-I
common	Rebuttal-I
arguments	Rebuttal-I
against	Rebuttal-I
homeschooling	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
that	Rebuttal-I
children	Rebuttal-I
who	Rebuttal-I
learn	Rebuttal-I
at	Rebuttal-I
home	Rebuttal-I
will	Rebuttal-I
not	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
opportunities	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
socialize	Rebuttal-I
with	Rebuttal-I
their	Rebuttal-I
peers	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
While	Rebuttal-I
it	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
true	Rebuttal-I
that	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
may	Rebuttal-I
not	Rebuttal-I
spend	Rebuttal-I
six	Rebuttal-I
hours	Rebuttal-I

same-age	Rebuttal-I

All	Refutation-I
of	Refutation-I
these	Refutation-I
situations	Refutation-I
encourage	Refutation-I
development	Refutation-I
of	Refutation-I
social	Refutation-I
and	Refutation-I
conflict-resolution	Refutation-I
skills	Refutation-I
,	Refutation-I
expect	Refutation-I
courteous	Refutation-I

respectful	Refutation-I
behavior	Refutation-I

expose	Refutation-I
children	Refutation-I
to	Refutation-I
diversity	Refutation-I

Additionally	Refutation-I

many	Refutation-I

families	Refutation-I
belong	Refutation-I

Another	Rebuttal-B
argument	Rebuttal-I
against	Rebuttal-I
homeschooling	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
that	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
may	Rebuttal-I
not	Rebuttal-I
be	Rebuttal-I
exposed	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
same	Rebuttal-I
rigorous	Rebuttal-I
curriculum	Rebuttal-I
standards	Rebuttal-I
at	Rebuttal-I
home	Rebuttal-I
as	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
would	Rebuttal-I
be	Rebuttal-I
at	Rebuttal-I
school	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
which	Rebuttal-I
would	Rebuttal-I
make	Rebuttal-I
it	Rebuttal-I
difficult	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
be	Rebuttal-I
accepted	Rebuttal-I
at	Rebuttal-I
postsecondary	Rebuttal-I
institutions	Rebuttal-I

This	Refutation-B
