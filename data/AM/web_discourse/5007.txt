,	Rebuttal-I
parents	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
teachers	Rebuttal-I

Here	O
is	O
my	O
experience	O
.	O
First	Rebuttal-B
,	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
with	Rebuttal-I
learning	Rebuttal-I
disabilities	Rebuttal-I
tend	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
be	Rebuttal-I
self	Rebuttal-I
conscious	Rebuttal-I
of	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
fact	Rebuttal-I
that	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
a	Rebuttal-I
learning	Rebuttal-I
disability	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
As	Rebuttal-I
with	Rebuttal-I
any	Rebuttal-I
generalization	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
there	Rebuttal-I
are	Rebuttal-I
exceptions	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
rule	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
but	Rebuttal-I
this	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
what	Rebuttal-I
I	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
seen	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
The	Rebuttal-I
self	Rebuttal-I
consciousness	Rebuttal-I
hinders	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
from	Rebuttal-I
asking	Rebuttal-I
questions	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
therefore	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
get	Rebuttal-I
more	Rebuttal-I
frustrated	Rebuttal-I
by	Rebuttal-I
not	Rebuttal-I
understanding	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
material	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
Traditional	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
also	Rebuttal-I
try	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
refrain	Rebuttal-I
from	Rebuttal-I
asking	Rebuttal-I
questions	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
because	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
don	Rebuttal-I
'	Rebuttal-I
t	Rebuttal-I
want	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
look	Rebuttal-I
dumb	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
For	Rebuttal-I
a	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
student	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
this	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
magnified	Rebuttal-I
tremendously	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
Second	Rebuttal-B
,	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
typically	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
some	Rebuttal-I
modifications	Rebuttal-I
or	Rebuttal-I
accommodations	Rebuttal-I
written	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
their	Rebuttal-I
Individualized	Rebuttal-I
Education	Rebuttal-I
Plan	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
Oftentimes	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
their	Rebuttal-I
plan	Rebuttal-I
allows	Rebuttal-I
them	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
use	Rebuttal-I
notes	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
a	Rebuttal-I
calculator	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
/	Rebuttal-I
or	Rebuttal-I
textbooks	Rebuttal-I
on	Rebuttal-I
tests	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
This	Rebuttal-I
means	Rebuttal-I
that	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
choose	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
take	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
test	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
—	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
attention	Rebuttal-I
drawn	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
them	Rebuttal-I
because	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
get	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
treatment	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
other	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
eyes	Rebuttal-I
—	Rebuttal-I
or	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
take	Rebuttal-I
their	Rebuttal-I
test	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
testing	Rebuttal-I
center	Rebuttal-I
where	Rebuttal-I
they	Rebuttal-I
can	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
more	Rebuttal-I
privacy	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
In	Rebuttal-I
addition	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
tend	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
need	Rebuttal-I
more	Rebuttal-I
one-on-one	Rebuttal-I
instruction	Rebuttal-I
without	Rebuttal-I
distractions	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
When	Rebuttal-I
classes	Rebuttal-I
are	Rebuttal-I
filled	Rebuttal-I
with	Rebuttal-I
36	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
40	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
per	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
one-on-one	Rebuttal-I
instruction	Rebuttal-I
becomes	Rebuttal-I
impossible	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
Lastly	Rebuttal-B
,	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
teachers	Rebuttal-I
catch	Rebuttal-I
on	Rebuttal-I
quickly	Rebuttal-I
which	Rebuttal-I
traditional	Rebuttal-I
teachers	Rebuttal-I
are	Rebuttal-I
going	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
take	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
time	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
help	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
kids	Rebuttal-I
on	Rebuttal-I
their	Rebuttal-I
case	Rebuttal-I
load	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
I	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
always	Rebuttal-I
taken	Rebuttal-I
time	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
help	Rebuttal-I
as	Rebuttal-I
many	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
as	Rebuttal-I
possible	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
both	Rebuttal-I
traditional	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
Special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
teachers	Rebuttal-I
see	Rebuttal-I
this	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
place	Rebuttal-I
more	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
my	Rebuttal-I
classes	Rebuttal-I
than	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
other	Rebuttal-I
math	Rebuttal-I
teachers	Rebuttal-I
'	Rebuttal-I
classes	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
I	Rebuttal-I
will	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
10	Rebuttal-I
special	Rebuttal-I
education	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
one	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
period	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
another	Rebuttal-I
math	Rebuttal-I
teacher	Rebuttal-I
with	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
same	Rebuttal-I
class	Rebuttal-I
in	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
same	Rebuttal-I
period	Rebuttal-I
will	Rebuttal-I
have	Rebuttal-I
none	Rebuttal-I
.	Rebuttal-I
This	Rebuttal-I
puts	Rebuttal-I
a	Rebuttal-I
tremendous	Rebuttal-I
amount	Rebuttal-I
of	Rebuttal-I
pressure	Rebuttal-I
on	Rebuttal-I
me	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
as	Rebuttal-I
I	Rebuttal-I
want	Rebuttal-I
to	Rebuttal-I
help	Rebuttal-I
all	Rebuttal-I
of	Rebuttal-I
my	Rebuttal-I
students	Rebuttal-I
,	Rebuttal-I
but	Rebuttal-I
can	Rebuttal-I
'	Rebuttal-I
t	Rebuttal-I
provide	Rebuttal-I
the	Rebuttal-I
one-on-one	Rebuttal-I

my	Rebuttal-I

The	O
