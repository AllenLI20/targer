reached	O
the	O

conclusions	O

this	O

'	O

serious	O
case	O
review	O
–	O
that	O
the	O

that	O

if	O

in	O

It	O
seems	O
that	O
Khyra	O
'	O

last	O

was	O
that	O
the	O

might	O
intervene	O
once	O
her	O
mother	O
had	O
withdrawn	O
her	O
from	O

.	O
The	O
principle	O
seems	O
straightforward	O
–	O
through	O
registration	O
,	O
all	O
home-educated	O
children	O
would	O
become	O
visible	O
to	O
the	O

them	O
–	O

ensure	O
that	O
the	O
education	O

received	O
is	O
adequate	O

But	O
Khyra	O
was	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
risk	O
by	O
the	O
agencies	O
whose	O
job	O

was	O
to	O

her	O
both	O
before	O

after	O
her	O

The	O
unpleasant	O
fact	O
is	O
that	O
parents	O
who	O
want	O
to	O

have	O
ample	O
opportunity	O
wherever	O

belief	O
that	O

the	O
conflating	O

a	O
