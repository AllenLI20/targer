it	Rebuttal-I
can	Rebuttal-I

years	Rebuttal-I
of	Rebuttal-I
elementary	Rebuttal-I

,	Rebuttal-I
and	Rebuttal-I
this	Rebuttal-I
is	Rebuttal-I
especially	Rebuttal-I
true	Rebuttal-I
for	Rebuttal-I

However	Refutation-B
,	Refutation-I
evidence	Refutation-I
also	Refutation-I
indicates	Refutation-I
that	Refutation-I
age	Refutation-I
at	Refutation-I
school	Refutation-I

is	Refutation-I
a	Refutation-I
poor	Refutation-I

success	Refutation-I

with	Refutation-I

performing	Refutation-I
just	Refutation-I

better	Refutation-I

their	Refutation-I
older	Refutation-I

.	Refutation-I
And	Premise-B
,	Premise-I
some	Premise-I
studies	Premise-I
indicate	Premise-I
that	Premise-I
children	Premise-I
who	Premise-I
are	Premise-I
redshirted	Premise-I
also	Premise-I
have	Premise-I
higher	Premise-I
use	Premise-I
of	Premise-I
special	Premise-I
education	Premise-I

higher	Premise-I
rates	Premise-I
of	Premise-I
behavioral	Premise-I
problems	Premise-I
in	Premise-I
adolescence	Premise-I

This	Premise-I
may	Premise-I
be	Premise-I
because	Premise-I
the	Premise-I
children	Premise-I
who	Premise-I

Socially	Backing-I

be	Backing-I
helpful	Backing-I
for	Backing-I
him	Backing-I

at	Backing-I
